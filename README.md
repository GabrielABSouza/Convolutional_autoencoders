# 🧠 Convolutional Autoencoder for MNIST Digit Reconstruction

This repository contains a simple yet effective convolutional autoencoder implemented in Keras to reconstruct handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning of efficient codings.

## 📌 Project Overview

The autoencoder learns to compress (encode) and then reconstruct (decode) the MNIST images. The model captures key features of the digits while reducing noise and dimensionality.

### ✨ Features

- Built with **Keras** and **TensorFlow**
- Handles image preprocessing and normalization
- Trains on the **MNIST dataset** of handwritten digits
- Visualizes original vs. reconstructed images

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.10.13
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

📊 Sample Results
After training, the model will display side-by-side comparisons of input digits and their reconstructed outputs. This allows a visual evaluation of the autoencoder's performance.
